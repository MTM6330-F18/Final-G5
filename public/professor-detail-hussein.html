      My experience with the IMD program has been very good and it is getting
      better and I see a lot of potential and I feel that I’m up to date with
      what’s out there in the industry now. I’m really happy that now we have
      lots of teachers and that brings in a lot of experience. What I enjoy most
      is teaching – I love teaching.<br />

      The way I see it is, IMD brings in a lot of areas under one umbrella. For
      example, if you are a graphic designer most of your focus would be on
      graphic design but in today’s day and age an employer looking to hire an
      employee is looking for someone who knows a little bit about everything
      but of course with some niche expertise in one specific area. For example
      if you are working as a graphic designer every now and then you would get
      questions about websites or photography and vice versa. I think IMD is
      very good as it combines everything and when you have all the skill sets
      such as graphic design, motion design, video, photography including the
      front end and back end web development you have a better demand. When you
      have expertise and experience in a lot of fields it is easier for you to
      become a Project Manager because you know how to manage things. Towards
      your graduation or end of the program you have to be able carve out your
      niche and say you are focusing on a particular area or that you are an
      expert in a particular area because you cannot be the master of
      everything.
