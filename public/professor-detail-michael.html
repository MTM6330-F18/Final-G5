      I started teaching in January 2016, and it has been a unique and
      challenging experience, but it comes with its rewards. Of course, what I
      enjoy most is being able to impact my students and help them achieve.

      It is not the goal of the IMD program to teach everything you need to know
      to enter the job market, but to give you a taste of many different
      opportunities ahead. However, to take advantage of those opportunities,
      you must not be afraid to try new things and embrace change. In this
      field, things are changing all the time, and there is a constant array of
      new things to learn. You can choose to sit by the sidelines or you can be
      the one who is riding the wave. Those who can accept those challenges will
      enjoy a long, rewarding career.
